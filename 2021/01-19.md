### Notes
- Safia
    - Narrowed down technical writer search to two people.
    - Wants to talk to them more because nteract docs are in a different state than a lot of the projects they've worked on. Make sure they are up for the challenge.
- Matt
    - Trying to catch up on issues on nbformat and papermill. Could probably use another set of eyes on that.
    - Updated scrapbook conda recipe.
    - Tried to do a conda recipe for [ipypandex](https://github.com/nteract/ipypandex), but can't run pytest; the tests just aren't there for some reason. May need to ask for help.
    - Talks with Safia about widgets issues. Originally, widgets are across the whole notebook, but in nteract is handled by widget manager. Something must not be quite right because there are still problems. Widget output object is causing particular problems because it doesn't follow the rules of the other widget.
- Carol
    - Thanks to Safia for helping out with widgets work!
